# CiphersPractice


This project is for a Talk to university students in Hermosillo, Sonora, MÃ©xico.

Contains a very simple implementation of the following cipher algorithms:

Caesar algorithm (and by inheritance, the ROT13 algorithm).
Vigenere algorithm.

In the future, the SHA-1 algorithm will (or should at least) be added.

Do not ever use any of this implementantions in any production environment.
